LUNER LANDER WITH DEEP Q-LEARNING

-> This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to land a spacecraft in the LunarLander-v2 environment using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).
-> The agent is trained to maximize its score by successfully landing on the lunar surface while minimizing bounces and crashes.
->The LunarLander-v2 environment is part of the OpenAI Gym and simulates the landing of a spacecraft on the Moon. 
->The agent uses a Deep Q-Network to learn optimal landing strategies through trial and error. 
->The goal is to land the spacecraft safely on the landing pad while maximizing the score.
